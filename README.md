# MiniCheckStep1

This project was inspired by **David J. Malan** and Harvard’s **CS50** course.  
As a computer science teacher, I decided to start building my own **mini check50-like system** that can automatically test and give feedback on student code.  
This repository is the first step in that journey.

## What’s here so far
- .NET 8 console application
- Basic user input (reads a name, prints a greeting)
- Git version control
- Published on GitHub

## How to run (VS Code terminal)
1. Open the built-in terminal in VS Code.
